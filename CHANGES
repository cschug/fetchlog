0.91	15 April 2002
	- initial public release

0.92	23 April 2002
	- make calling conventions compatible to Netsaint plugins
	- update README and man page:  Netsaint integration as plugin

0.93	09 July 2002
	- bugfix: conversion accidently took place multiple times. fixed
	- bugfix/Extension: postprocessing the result of fetchlog with shell
	  commands results in unexpected behaviour if the fetched message 
	  contains shell metacharacters: '"`^$\ 
	  Introduced the new conversion s to convert the above meta characters
	  to _ and / respectively. 
	  Netsaint's mail notification system is known to be affected from this
	  bug. Netsaint users should upgrade to 0.93 and add conversion s to
	  the fetchlog call.
	- Change: Meaning of exitcodes 1 und 2 exchanged to make fetchlog
	  more Netsaint plugin compatible. Added a compile-time option in
	  Makefile to optionally make fetchlog return the pre-0.93 exitcodes.
	- Doku updated.

0.94	17 Dec 2002
	- inserted CVS tags
	- updated docs: Netsaint --> Nagios (TM)
	- exit code -1 for 'UNKNOWN' now 3 to be Nagios/Posix compatible
	  
0.95 	18 Nov 2003
	- removed compile option pre 0.93 exit codes
	- no longer use copy of last line fetched to find bookmark location
	- use inode to identify a (rotated) logfile instead
	- handling of empty (and rotated) logfiles now correct

1.0	26 Mar 2004
	- added regex pattern matching: fetch only messages matching one of
	  the (regex) patterns given as optional parameters

1.1	20 Nov 2008
	- updated docs, fixed typo's
	- now '|' is shell critical character also (option convert 'shell')
	- added Greg Baker's files for building a .depot on hpux

1.2	23 Nov 2008
	- forgotten to update CHANGES in already released and published 1.1
	  release, so we made 1.2

1.3	16 Jun 2010
	- new option '3' for nagios3 compatible (multiline) output
	- Added sample configs for Nagios 2 + 3
	- Updated README.Nagios to Nagios 2 + 3
	- Scanning for rotated logfiles now silently skips over to .1 if
	  .0 is missing because some rotation tools start indexing with .1
	- fixed: compiler warnings on Debian Linux

1.4	28 Jun 2010
	- bugfix: when using regex: when logfile has changed without new
	  messages matching 'regex' fetchlog returned an empty message as
	  'have messages' / exitcode 2 instead of 'no messages' / exitcode 0
	  (This bug was introduced in 1.3 with conversion '3')
	- introduced make target 'testall' to stress test fetchlog

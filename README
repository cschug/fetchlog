WHAT IT IS

  from the man page:

      fetchlog -f firstcol:lastcol:len:conv logfile bookmarkfile [pattern ...]
      fetchlog -F firstcol:lastcol:len:conv logfile bookmarkfile [pattern ...]

  The fetchlog utility displays the last new messages of a logfile. It is 
  similar like tail (1) but offers some extra functionality for output
  formatting. To show only the new messages appeared since the last call
  fetchlog uses a bookmark to remember which messages have been fetched.

  fetchlog scans backwards a logfile and collects all messages, optionally
  only those matching any of the given regex-style patterns. Then fetchlog
  converts found message lines for output. It stops scanning when one of 
  these conditions become true: The bookmark from bookmarkfile is reached, 
  or more than len characters are ready for output, or an error occurs. 
  fetchlog knows about rotated and uncompressed logfiles and continues 
  scanning in rotated logfiles by appending '.0'/'.1' upto '.9' to logfile 
  when scanning in rotated logfiles. Scanning stops without error when a 
  rotated logfile does not exist.

  fetchlog may be used as a local plugin for the Nagios network monitoring 
  system to monitor a local logfile. It follows the calling convention for 
  Nagios plugins when conversion is set at least to 'no' and len is short
  enough for Nagios. Nagios can monitor remote logfiles together 
  with NET-SNMP and fetchlog using the check-snmp plugin.

REQUIREMENTS
  
  A ANSI C compiler. 
  
  Platforms known to work:
     FreeBSD 4.x and later
     Linux x86  Kernel 2.2  and later
     Solaris 2.6 with gcc
     Irix 6.5 with gcc or cc
     HP-UX
     Debian based Linux


INSTALL

  Note for HP-UX: please use fetchlog-Makefile.hpux with target 
  'fetchlog.depot' to build a fetchlog.depot.

  All others:

  After uncompressing the distribution read the 'user settings' section
  in Makefile to set the compiler, the compile flags and the installation dir.

  Do a 
	make

  If compilation fails because of 'MADV_RANDOM' undeclared'
  then comment the line noted in Makefile (HAS_MADVISE).

  If compilation fails because of missing regex functions in your operating
  system with symptoms like:
       compiler: "fetchlog.c: Can't find include file regex.h"
       compiler: "fetchlog.c: unknown symbol REG_EXTENDED / REG_NOSUB"
       linker:   "unknown symbol regexec/regcomp/regerror"
  then comment the line in Makefile (HAS_REGEX)

  Test the compiled program with a
	make test

  If you get 'ERROR: fetchlog: madvise: Invalid argument' then your system
  does not support the RANDOM option for madvise() system call. Please edit
  the Makefile: comment the line noted in Makefile (HAS_MADVISE), then do a
     	make clean
	make

  and test again.

  To do a long test do 'make testall', but notice: this test is implemented
  as a shell script and has only been testet on FreeBSD.

  To install in INSTDIR set in Makefile type:
	make install

  This will install the binary 'fetchlog' in INSTDIR/bin and the manpage in
  INSTDIR/man/man1. These dirs have to exist else installation fails.


UPGRADE

  Install the new version over the old version. If you made any changes to
  the old Makefile, apply them to the new Makefile, too. See INSTALL.

  Remove the old bookmarkfiles! 


EXAMPLE

  To send out an email if new messages in /var/log/messages appeared within
  the last 10 minutes, create a shell script similar like this:

  --------------- snip -------------------
  #!/bin/sh
  HOST=`hostname`
  FETCHLOG="/usr/local/bin/fetchlog -F 1:80:1000:s"
  MSG=`$FETCHLOG /var/log/messages /tmp/msgbm`
  if [ $? -gt 0 ] 
  then
        echo -e "$MSG" | \
        /usr/bin/mail -s "SYSLOG: $HOST" admin@your.domain
  fi
  --------------- snap -------------------
  
  and add an entry in the crontab:

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /path/to/shellscript >/dev/null 2>&1

  It is not necessary to run the cronjob as root if /var/log/messages is 
  readable for other users. 

  Note: To avoid missing some messages check the rotation method for 
 	/var/log/messages: fetchlog does not work with compressed logfiles.

  Note: If your mailing subsystem causes messages to appear in 
	/var/log/messages you most probably have a severe problem.
  
  If you only want to pick 'serious' messages from a 'bubbled'
  modify the MSG=... line above like this:

  MSG=`$FETCHLOG /var/log/messages /tmp/msgbm 'bubbled.*serious'`


  Other example: A tail -f thing that beeps whenever there is something 
  with device0..3 or the sun is going down:

  --------------- snip -------------------
  #!/bin/sh
  FETCHLOG="/usr/local/bin/fetchlog -F 1:100:1000:"
  while true; do
     MSG=`$FETCHLOG /var/log/messages /tmp/msgbm 'device[0-3]' 'sun.*down'`
     if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then
        echo -e "$MSG"
        echo ^G; sleep 1; echo ^G
     fi
     sleep 5
  done
  --------------- snap -------------------



DOWNLOAD
  
  Please look at http://fetchlog.sourceforge.net for current versions.


FURTHER READING
 
  The man page.

  If you wanted just another tool to peek in your logfiles you are done.

  If you want to do a remote look at your logfiles via SNMP please read the
  file README.SNMP. Here you will find a setup for the NET-SNMP 
  utilities. (for NET-SNMP please see http://www.net-snmp.org )

  If you want to monitor your logfiles with the Network Monitor 
  software Nagios, please first read the file README.SNMP for remote 
  fetching and/or then README.Nagios. Users of other monitoring software 
  may want to read this too. 
  (for Nagios please see http://www.nagios.org )
